# note-reading-tutor
An app that tutors a student on note reading and collects results which can then be viewed by their teacher.

### Background
When a music student is learning to read music, they are often sent home to practice out of a book. Without guidance/supervision, it's not uncommon for a student to:

1. Not realize they are making mistakes
2. Not practice because they are unsure/discouraged/bored.
